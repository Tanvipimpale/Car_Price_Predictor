🚗 Car Price Predictor using Machine Learning

This project predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, year of purchase, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more. It uses a Linear Regression model — one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms — to establish the relationship between car features and their market prices.
